# Stroke_Prediction
Stroke prediction project is an Machine Learing based project that aims to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke. The project uses a dataset of medical records of individuals and employs machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors that may contribute to a person having a stroke such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, etc.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The selected model is then deployed to make predictions on new unseen data.

This project is important because stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and early prediction and diagnosis can save lives and improve health outcomes. The project can be used by medical practitioners to assist in the diagnosis of stroke and by individuals to assess their own risk of having a stroke.

 It is built using Python and various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.
